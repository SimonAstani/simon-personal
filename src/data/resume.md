- Optimized application performance and code modularity. Participated in code reviews, suggested feedback, and wrote unit test cases for front-end applications.
- Brand Refresh the existing component and user interface as per the updated UI kit and company branding standards.
- Build reusable components in the shared library to implement in main applications for modularity, reusability, and maintainability.
- Documented front-end and back-end project setup process on the confluence page to streamline onboarding and knowledge sharing.
- Participated in Agile ceremonies, including daily standups, sprint reviews, retrospectives, sprint planning, and team refinement ensuring effective collaboration

**Thrivent Financial, Minneapolis, MN (May 2023 – Oct 2024)**

- Designed and developed microservices architecture, utilizing Java 17 with Spring Boot and AWS services for scalability and maintainability.
- Experience managing and accessing data using JDBC, JPA, and Hibernate while working with relational databases, such as MySQL and PostgreSQL.
- Used Angular 15 services to manage tasks like data access, authentication, and caching, and Angular routing to navigate between various pages and components.
- Tested applications using Angular testing frameworks such as Jasmine and Karma, and was deployed to a production environment using the Angular CLI.
- Strong background with Unix scripting and job automation, having created and managed shell scripts for automating deployment processes, system monitoring, and routine maintenance tasks, as well as using Cron jobs to schedule tasks such as log rotation and backups
- Developed extensive error handling and retry mechanisms within Kafka producers and consumers, ensuring message delivery reliability and resilience under adverse conditions.
- Designed Kafka consumers to process messages in parallel using multiple threads or consumer instances within a group, enabling rapid data processing and minimizing consumer lag.
- Developed RESTful APIs and a responsive web layer with Spring MVC and Spring Boot, delivering efficient and scalable request handling.
- Applied security best practices, such as data encryption, authentication, and authorization, to guarantee the confidentiality and integrity of sensitive data.
- Ensured code stability and reliability through rigorous unit and integration testing practices using JUnit and Mockito.
- Optimized application performance through load testing, profiling, and code reviews, resulting in improved user experiences and resource efficiency.
- Established centralized logging with Log4j, simplifying troubleshooting efforts through effective log correlation and analysis.
- Created thorough documentation for codebases and led training sessions to orient team members and guarantee knowledge sharing.
- Built and deployed Spring Boot applications, utilizing the framework's support for microservices architecture and quick development.
- Responsible for designing and implementing CI/CD pipelines with Jenkins and GitLab CI, as well as integrating them with tools like BitBucket for version control, Ansible for configuration management, and - JFrog Artifactory for artifact storage.
- Used Docker to build and deploy containerized applications, which I then orchestrated with Kubernetes for scalability, reliability, and consistency across environments. In addition, I used XL Release to simplify and automate the release process to reduce manual intervention and deployment risks.
- Implemented security best practices on AWS, such as IAM (Identity and Access Management) policies, MFA (Multi-Factor Authentication), and encryption at rest and in transit.
- Created custom alarms and dashboards for monitoring and logging using AWS CloudWatch and AWS CloudTrail to provide real-time insight into the health of your applications.
- Accelerated data access performance with shorter response times through strategic caching, query optimization, and database indexing.
- Ensured portability and scalability by using containerization technologies like Docker for packaging applications and Kubernetes for orchestration.
- Implemented Git workflows like Gitflow or feature branching, ensuring organized and structured development processes.
- Participated in sprint planning, daily stand-ups, and retrospectives in Agile development teams to ensure efficient and collaborative development.
- Implemented end-to-end automation of builds, tests, and releases using Jenkins, significantly enhancing software delivery velocity and maintaining top-tier software quality.
